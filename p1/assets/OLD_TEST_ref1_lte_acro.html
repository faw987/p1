tablishing a terminal’s identity, configuring authorizations to access particu-
lar types of service, and monitoring traffic volumes for each user. this is AAA .See 3GPP
TS29.273, and TS23.002 Sections 4.1.4.6 and 4.1.4.7.

ABM Asynchronous Balanced Mode. A mode of packet data transfer used, for
example, by the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer for acknowledged bi-
directional communication between a mobile station and a Serving GPRS
Support Node (SGSN), which includes error recovery procedures and provides
in-sequence delivery. Balanced mode implies that the station at either end of
the link has the right to set-up, reset, or disconnect a link at any time (i.e. there
is no master/slave relationship). See 3GPP TS44.064.

ABQP Aggregate Base Station Subsystem Quality of Service Profile. Defines the
Quality of Service (QoS) profile for a Base Station Subsystem (BSS) packet
flow context. See 3GPP TS48.018 Section 11.3.43 and TS24.008 Section
10.5.6.5.

AC Access Class. All UEs are randomly allocated to one of ten ACs, the allocated
AC being stored in the Subscriber Identity Module/Universal Subscriber Iden-
tity Module (SIM/USIM). In addition, UEs may belong to a special AC (e.g.
for emergency services or network operators). The AC is used in determin-
ing whether the UE may attempt to access the network. See 3GPP TS22.011
Section 4.

ACI Adjacent Channel Interference. Received interference arising from transmis-
sions in an adjacent Radio Frequency (RF) channel.
ACIR Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio. The ratio of the total power transmitted
from a source to the total interference power affecting a victim receiver, re-
sulting from both transmitter and receiver imperfections. It is a function of the
Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) and the Adjacent Channel Selectiv-
ity (ACS), i.e. ACIR ~= 11ACLR+ 1ACS.

ACK ACKnowledgment. A signal transmitted to indicate that one or more blocks of
data have been successfully received and decoded. It is used in Hybrid Auto-
matic Repeat reQuest (HARQ), as well as in Radio Link Control (RLC) level
ARQ.

ACLR Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio. A measure of the power which leaks into cer-
tain specific nearby Radio Frequency (RF) channels as a result of transmitting
in a given channel. It provides an estimate of how much a neighbouring radio
receiver will be affected by the Out Of Band (OOB) emissions from a trans-
mitter. It is defined as the ratio of the filtered mean power in a set bandwidth
within the wanted channel to the filtered mean power in an adjacent channel.
See 3GPP TS36.101 Section 6.6.2.3.

ACRR Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio. Used in the context of repeaters. It is the ra-
tio of the Root Raised Cosine (RRC) weighted gain per carrier of the repeater in
the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the repeater on an adjacent channel.
See 3GPP TS 36.106 Section 13.

ACS Adjacent Channel Selectivity. A measure of a receiver’s ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an adjacent
channel interfering signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency
of the assigned channel, without the interfering signal causing a degradation
of the receiver performance beyond a specified limit. ACS is predominantly
defined by the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel
frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel. See 3GPP
TS36.101 Section 7.5.
