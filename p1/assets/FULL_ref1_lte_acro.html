nals emitted by the equipment under test. See 3GPP TS36.113 and IEC 61000
(www.iec.ch).</p>

CF Contention-Free. Referring to the random access procedure, CF is an access
mode in which only one user has permission to access a given transmission
resource. CF random access operates in LTE by assigning a dedicated Random

sion in a particular RACH slot. This is in contrast to contention-based random
access, where multiple users may transmit a signal in the same time-frequency
resources, and a contention resolution procedure is then required to separate
the different users. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section 10.1.5.2.
Referring to turbo-code interleaver design, CF describes an interleaver in which

scheduled data traffic, and control signalling if some is required to be transmit-
ted in the same subframe. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section 5.3.

PWS Public Warning System. A PWS provides the ability to broadcast warnings
to alert the public to major emergencies, such as natural and other disasters.
Such a system may also broadcast information allowing emergency services
to request public assistance, for example when life is in danger. See 3GPP
TS22.268.

QAM Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. QAM involves modulating the amplitude
of two separate carrier waves, exactly 90 degrees out of phase with each other
(sine and cosine). These are therefore called quadrature carriers, from which
the scheme derives its name. M-QAM conveys information by means of M
different combinations of amplitudes of the two carriers (vM possible am-
plitudes on each carrier), and hence log2(M) information bits are conveyed
per QAM symbol. In LTE M=16 or 64 for both uplink and downlink (although
M=64 is optional for the uplink). See 3GPP TS36.211 Sections 5.3.2 and 6.3.2.

QCI Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier. A parameter of the QoS profile of an
Evolved Packet System (EPS) bearer. It is a scalar which refers to access node-
specific parameters that control bearer-level packet forwarding treatment (e.g.
scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds, link
layer protocol configuration). See 3GPP TS23.401 Section 4.7.3 and TS23.203
Annex J.

QoS Quality of Service. A descriptor of the level of performance provided in trans-
mission of data. Typical QoS metrics include bit rate, delay, bit/block error
rate, maximum blocking probability and outage probability. QoS guarantees
are especially important for real-time streaming applications, such as Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP), since these are often delay-sensitive.

QPP Quadratic Permutation Polynomial. QPPs are used to define the turbo cod-
ing interleavers in LTE. For an information block size K, a QPP interleaver
is defined by the following polynomial: (i) = (f1i + f2i2) mod K, where
i is the output index(0 = i = K - 1), (i) is the input index and f1 and f2
are the coefficients that define the permutation, with f1 being relatively prime
to the block size K and all prime factors of K also being factors of f2. 188
such interleaver polynomials are defined for LTE. See 3GPP TS36.212 Section
5.1.3.2.3.

QPSK Quadrature Phase Shift Keying. QPSK is a modulation scheme in which in-
formation is conveyed through phase variations of a carrier, while keeping a
constant amplitude and frequency. The four phases are 0, /2, , 3/2, en-
abling log2(4) = 2 information bits to be conveyed per QPSK symbol. See
3GPP TS36.211 Sections 5.3.2 and 6.3.2.

R Reserved. A bit field, usually in a message header, which is reserved for possi-
ble use in a later version of the specifications.
r.m.s root mean square. A statistical measure of the magnitude of a series of values.
It is the square root of the mean of the squares of the values.

RA Random Access. A procedure by which a UE can access the network, gen-
erally by random selection of a transmission resource rather than by specific
assignment. The random access procedure in LTE is used when a UE is not
allocated with uplink radio resources but has data to transmit, or when the UE
is not time-synchronized in the uplink direction. See 3GPP TS36.321, Section
5.1 and TS36.213 Section 6.

RA Resource Allocation. RA is part of the radio resource management functional-
ity and is performed by the eNodeB. It comprises allocation and de-allocation
of transmission resources for both user and control plane packets, including
the selection of radio bearers whose packets are to be scheduled and determin-
ing power levels and specific resource blocks to be used. It typically takes into
account the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, any channel quality infor-
mation, buffer status reports and/or restrictions related to inter-cell interference
coordination considerations. See 3GPP TS36.213, Sections 7.1.6 and 8.1.

RA Routing Area. An area in which a mobile station, in certain operation modes,
may move freely without updating the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).
An RA includes one or several GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN)
or UTRAN cells. An RA is always contained within a location area.

RAB Radio Access Bearer. A service provided by the Access Stratum (AS) to the
Non-Access Stratum (NAS) for the transfer of user data between the UE and
the Core Network (CN).

RAC Radio Admission Control. The RAC function is located in the eNodeB and
controls admission or rejection of new radio bearer establishment requests. The
goal of RAC is to maximize radio resource utilization while ensuring that the
required Quality of Service (QoS) is achieved for sessions which are already
established. RAC can take into account the overall resource situation in E-
UTRAN, the QoS requirements, the priority levels, the provided QoS of in-
progress sessions and the QoS requirements of new radio bearer requests. See
3GPP TS36.300, Section 16.1.2.

RAC Routing Area Code. The RAC is part of the Routing Area Identity (RAI). The
RAC identifies a routing area within a location area. It has a fixed length of 1
octet. See 3GPP TS23.003 Section 4.2.

RACH Random Access CHannel. A transport channel used for access to the network
when the UE does not have accurate uplink timing synchronization, or when
the UE does not have any allocated uplink transmission resource. The RACH
is normally contention-based, which may result in collisions between UEs. See
3GPP TS36.321.

RAI Routing Area Identity. Used for paging and registration purposes. It is com-
posed of the Location Area Identity (LAI) and the Routing Area Code (RAC).
See 3GPP TS23.003 Section 4.2.

RAN Radio Access Network. A RAN consists of the ground-based infrastructure
required for delivery of communication between UEs and the Core Network
(CN). In LTE, the RAN consists of one or more base stations (i.e. eNodeBs).
Examples of other RANs are UMTS, TD-SCDMA, GSM, CDMA2000 and
WiMAX.

RAPID Random Access Preamble IDentifier. A field of the Medium Access Control
(MAC) header for the Random Access Response (RAR). The RAPID field
identifies the transmitted random access preamble to which the RAR corre-
sponds. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section 6.2.2.

RAR Random Access Response. The message sent by the eNodeB in response to
a random access preamble. The RAR is sent by the eNodeB on the Physical
Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH), and addressed with the Random Access
Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RA-RNTI), which identifies the time-
frequency slot in which the preamble was detected. The RAR conveys the
identity of the detected preamble, a timing alignment instruction to synchronize
subsequent uplink transmissions from the UE, an initial uplink resource grant
for transmission of the next uplink message, and an assignment of a Cell-RNTI
(C-RNTI). The RAR message can also include a ‘backoff indicator’ which the
eNodeB can set to instruct the UE to back off for a period of time before retry-
ing a random access attempt. See 3GPP TS36.321 Sections 5.1.4 and 6.1.5.

RA-RNTI Random Access Radio Network Temporary Identifier. The RA-RNTI is used to
identify a message sent on the Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH)
as a Random Access Response (RAR). It also indicates the time-frequency slot
of the preamble to which the RAR corresponds. See 3GPP TS36.312 Section
5.1.4 and TS36.401, Section 6.2.8.1.


RAT Radio Access Technology. The RAT is the type of radio technology used in a
Radio Access Network (RAN) to access the Core Network (CN), e.g. UMTS,
GSM, CDMA2000, WiMAX.

RAU Routing Area Update. A RAU is triggered when a UE crosses a routing area
boundary from one routing area to another. A RAU can also be performed
periodically, with the time interval being set by the network.

RB Resource Block. A unit of transmission resource consisting of 12 subcarriers
in the frequency domain and 1 timeslot (0.5 ms) in the time domain. See 3GPP
TS36.211, Sections 5.2.3 and 6.2.3.

RB Radio Bearer. A service provided by the Layer 2 for the transfer of data be-
tween a UE and the E-UTRAN.

RBC Radio Bearer Control. A function located in the eNodeB for the management
(i.e. setting up, maintenance and release) of radio bearers. The setting up of
a radio bearer for a service is based on the overall resource situation in E-
UTRAN, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of current sessions
and the new service. RBC handles the maintenance of established radio bear-
ers when the radio resource situation changes, for example due to mobility.
RBC is involved in the release of radio resources associated with radio bearers,
for example at session termination or handover. See 3GPP TS36.300, Section
16.1.1.

RBG Resource Block Group. A RBG consists of 1, 2, 3 or 4 Physical Resource
Blocks (PRB), depending on the system bandwidth, which are consecutive in
the frequency domain and are in the same timeslot. The grouping of PRBs in
this way enables the signalling overhead to be reduced for downlink transmis-
sion resource allocation. See 3GPP TS36.213 Section 7.1.6.1.

RBG Radio Bearer Group. A RBG corresponds to a group of logical channels for
the purposes of uplink buffer status reporting. By grouping logical channels in
this way the signalling overhead for informing the eNodeB of arrival of high-
priority data in the UE’s buffer is reduced. See 3GPP TS36.300 Section 11.3
and TS36.321 Section 6.1.3.1.

RE Resource Element. The RE is the smallest unit of transmission resource in
LTE, in both uplink and downlink. An RE consists of 1 subcarrier in the fre-
quency domain for a duration of 1, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex-
ing (OFDM) or Single Carrier- Frequency Division Multiplexing(SC-FDM),
symbol in the time domain. See 3GPP TS36.211 Sections 5.2 and 6.2.

REFSENS REFerence SENSitivity power level. It is the minimum mean received signal
strength applied to both antenna ports at which there is sufficient SINR for a
given modulation scheme to meet 95% of the maximum throughput of a refer-
ence measurement channel. It is given by REFSENS = kTB + NF + SINR +
IM - 3 (dBm), where kTB is the thermal noise level in dBm in the bandwidth
B, NF is the prescribed maximum noise figure for the receiver, SINR is the
requirement for the chosen Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), IM is an
implementation margin and the -3 dB represents the diversity gain. See 3GPP
TS36.101, Section 7.3.

REG Resource Element Group. A group of four Resource Elements (REs). These
groups are used to structure the mapping of the downlink physical control chan-
nels (Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH), Physical Control Format
Indicator CHannel (PCFICH) and Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator CHannel
(PHICH)) to resource elements in the first Orthogonal Frequency Domain Mul-
tiplexing (OFDM) symbols of each subframe. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section
6.2.4.

RET Remote Electrical Tilting. A mechanism for changing electrically the overall
tilt of a base station antenna by increasing the lengths of different antenna
elements inside the antenna casing. This can be used to improve the over-
all coverage and bandwidth distribution of cells, in particular where manual
adjustment of the tilt of an antenna is expensive or impractical. RET allows
network operators to respond to changing capacity requirements. For back-
ground for UTRAN, see 3GPP TR25.802 and TS25.460, TS25.461, TS25.462,
TS25.463 and TS25.466.

RF Radio Frequency. Refers to signal oscillation frequencies such that if the signal
is input to an antenna an electromagnetic field is generated suitable for wireless
communication. These frequencies cover a significant part of the electromag-
netic radiation spectrum, ranging from a few kilohertz to hundreds of gigahertz.
See 3GPP TR36.942 for some discussion of related issues.

RF Resegmentation Flag. A field in a Radio Link Control (RLC) header indicating
whether the RLC Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is an Acknowledged Mode Data
(AMD) PDU or an Unacknowledged Mode Data (UMD) PDU segment. If the
RLC PDU is an AMD PDU segment, the RF field is set to 1, otherwise it is set
to 0. See 3GPP TS36.322 Section 6.2.2.10.

RFC Request for Comments. A type of memorandum that captures much of the
output of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These memoranda de-
scribe techniques and protocols related to the functioning of the internet and
internet-connected systems.

RFSP Radio Access Technology / Frequency Selection Priority. An index provided
by the Mobility Management Entity (MME) to an eNodeB across the S1 in-
terface to support radio resource management in E-UTRAN. The RFSP index
is mapped by the eNodeB to a locally defined configuration in order to ap-
ply specific Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategies. The RFSP index
is UE-specific and applies to all the radio bearers for that UE. See 3GPP
TS23.401 Section 4.3.6.

RI Rank Indicator. A RI is signalled to the eNodeB by UEs configured for Physical
Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH) transmission modes 3 (open-loop spatial
multiplexing) and 4 (closed-loop spatial multiplexing). It corresponds to the
number of useful transmission layers for spatial multiplexing (based on the
UE’s estimate of the downlink channel), enabling the eNodeB to adapt the
PDSCH transmissions accordingly. See 3GPP TS36.213 Section 7.2.

RIM Radio Access Network Information Management. The RIM provides a generic
method for the exchange of information between applications belonging to the
Radio Access Network (RAN) nodes. The RAN information is transferred via
the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and Serving GPRS Support Node
(SGSN) node(s). The RAN information is included in a RIM container which
is not interpreted by the Core Network (CN) nodes, such that the RAN infor-
mation is transparent to the CN. See 3GPP TS36.300, Section 19.2.1.13.

RIV Resource Indication Value. A field in Physical Downlink Control CHannel
(PDCCH) messages indicating contiguous Physical Resource Block (PRB) al-
locations to a UE; this includes all uplink resource grants, and some downlink
resource assignments. The RIV indicates the starting resource block of the
contiguous allocation and the length of the contiguous allocation of resource
blocks. See 3GPP TS36.213 Sections 7.1.6.3 and 8.1.

RL Radio Link. A logical communication link between a UE and an eNodeB, car-
rying one or several radio bearers.

RLC Radio Link Control. The RLC layer is located between the Packet Data Con-
vergence Protocol (PDCP) layer and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
in the LTE user plane protocol stack. The main functions of the RLC layer
are segmentation and reassembly of upper layer packets in order to adapt them
to the size which can actually be transmitted over the radio interface. For ra-
dio bearers which need error-free transmission, the RLC layer also performs
retransmission to recover from packet losses. Additionally, the RLC layer
performs reordering to compensate for out-of-order reception due to Hybrid
Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) operation in the MAC layer. There is one
RLC entity per radio bearer. See 3GPP TS36.322.

RLF Radio Link Failure. An RLF occurs when a UE is considered to have lost syn-
chronization with the downlink from the eNodeB, typically due to degradation
of the air interface arising from unfavourable signal propagation conditions, i.e.
when the received power level is lower than a predefined threshold, Qout. After
radio link failure detection and the expiration of a timer (T310), the UE enters
IDLE mode. See 3GPP TS36.300 Section 10.1.6, TS36.213 Section 4.2.1 and
TS36.331 Section 5.3.11.

RLP Radio Link Protocol. RLP covers the Layer 2 functionality of the ISO OSI
Reference Model, between the UE and the interworking function located at
the nearest Mobile Switching Centre (MSC). It is designed to support circuit
switched data transmission within a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN).
See 3GPP TS24.022.

RLS Recursive Least Squares. A technique used to find the coefficients of adaptive
filters by recursively computing the smallest values of the squares of the error
signal. This can be contrasted with Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)
filters, which aim to minimize the mean squared error. While MMSE filters
depend on the statistics of the signal, RLS filters are dependent on the signals
themselves.

RM Rate Matching. The RM process adapts the code rate of the LTE data trans-
missions such that the number of information and parity bits to be transmitted
matches the resource allocation. Based on the 1/3 mother code rate of the turbo
coder, the LTE RM uses a circular buffer to either repeat bits to decrease the
code rate or puncture bits to increase the code rate. See 3GPP TS36.212 Section
5.1.4.

RMC Reference Measurement Channel. RMCs provide defined sets of parameters
for transmitted channels to enable radio receiver performance to be analyzed
in a consistent way. See 3GPP TS36.101 Annex A.

RNC Radio Network Controller. The equipment in the UTRAN RNS in charge of
controlling the use and the integrity of the radio resources.
RNL Radio Network Layer. The RNL encompasses the radio network control plane
and the radio network user plane. It handles all Radio Access Bearer-related
functions.

RNS Radio Network Subsystem. Either a full UTRAN network or only the access
part of a UTRAN, offering the allocation and release of specific radio resources
to establish means of connection in between a UE and the UTRAN. An RNS
comprises a Radio Network Controller (RNC) and one or more NodeBs.

RNTI Radio Network Temporary Identifier. RNTIs are used to identify UEs within E-
UTRAN, in particular in signalling messages between the UE and E-UTRAN.
Several types of RNTI exist, including Cell-RNTI (C-RNTI), Paging-RNTI
(P-RNTI), Random Access-RNTI (RA-RNTI) and System Information-RNTI
(SI-RNTI). See 3GPP TS36.321 Section 7.1.

RNTP Relative Narrowband Transmit Power. RNTP indicates, per Physical Resource
Block (PRB), whether or not the cell intends to keep the downlink transmit
power in the PRB below a certain threshold. The value of this threshold, and
the period for which the RNTP indicator is valid in the future, are configurable.
This enables the neighbouring eNodeBs to take into account the expected level
of interference in each RB when scheduling UEs in their own cells. See 3GPP
TS36.213 Section 5.2.1.

ROHC RObust Header Compression. A standardized method to compress the Internet
Protocol (IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Real-time Transport Protocol
(RTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) headers of internet packets.
ROHC header compression operates by allowing both the sender and the re-
ceiver to store the static parts of the header (e.g. the IP addresses of the
sender/receiver), and to update these only when they change. Dynamic parts
(such as the timestamp in the RTP header) are compressed by transmitting
only the difference from a reference maintained in both the transmitter and the
receiver. See www.ietf.org.

RoT Rise over Thermal. RoT is defined as the ratio between the total power received
at a base station and the thermal noise at the base station. It provides a measure
of the uplink load level in a cell.

RPF RePetition Factor. A parameter defining the degree of repetition of time-
domain samples of a Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-
FDMA) signal used in the LTE uplink. An RPF = n means that the time-domain
samples are repeated n - 1 times (i.e. transmitted n times), resulting in the
signal occupying one subcarrier every n subcarriers in the frequency domain.
This can be used to generate Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access
(IFDMA) signals from different UEs. In LTE, this is applied to transmission
of the Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) in the uplink, with RPF = 2 allowing
SRS from two UEs to be interleaved across a given bandwidth while retaining
frequency-domain orthogonality.

R-PLMN Registered Public Land Mobile Network. The PLMN on which the UE has
performed a successful location registration.

RRC Radio Resource Control. The RRC protocol handles the Layer 3 control plane
signalling by which the E-UTRAN controls the UE behaviour. The RRC pro-
tocol supports the transfer of both common and dedicated Non-Access Stra-
tum information. It covers a number of functional areas including System
Information (SI) broadcasting, connection control including handover within
LTE, network-controlled inter-Radio Access Technology (RAT) mobility and
measurement configuration and reporting. See 3GPP TS36.300 Section 7 and
TS36.331.


RRC Root Raised Cosine. A filter shape, frequently used for pulse-shaping because
of its ability to minimize Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) when used at both the
transmitter and receiver – the two filters together having a Raised Cosine re-
sponse. The frequency response of an RRC filter is a piecewise function equal
to unity in the centre frequencies and approaching zero following the square-
root of a raised cosine curve. The sharpness of the frequency-domain roll-off
can be traded off against the amplitude of time-domain ripple in the filter im-
pulse response by varying the ‘roll-off factor’, typically referred to as . For
 = 0 the frequency response of the filter becomes a rectangular function, and
for  = 1 it is a pure root raised cosine.

RRM Radio Resource Management. RRM consists of the system-level control mech-
anisms used to manage radio resources in the air interface. The objective of
RRM is to maximize the system spectral efficiency and to support mobility for
the users. RRM therefore involves strategies and algorithms for resource allo-
cation, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), transmission power selection,
and mobility. See 3GPP TS36.133.

RS Reference Signal. A signal, known to the receiver, that is inserted into a
transmitted signal in order to facilitate channel estimation for coherent de-
modulation and measurements. In the LTE downlink, Cell-specific RSs are
provided which are available to all UEs in a cell; UE-specific RSs may be
embedded in the data for specific UEs, and Multimedia Broadcast Single Fre-
quency Network (MBSFN) -specific RSs are provided in case of MBSFN
operation. These RSs occupy specified Resource Elements (REs) within an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) symbol. In the LTE up-
link, Demodulation RSs (DM-RS) and Sounding RSs (SRS) are provided for
channel estimation for demodulation and channel sounding respectively. See
3GPP TS36.211 Sections 5.5 and 6.10.

RSCP Received Signal Code Power. A measurement used for mobility to UTRA. It
is the received power on the Primary Common PIlot CHannel (P-CPICH for
UMTS Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)), or the Primary Common Con-
trol Physical CHannel (for UMTS Time Division Duplex (TDD)) after de-
spreading. See 3GPP TS36.214 Section 5.1.4.

RSRP Reference Signal Received Power. An LTE measurement which provides a
cell-specific signal strength metric. This measurement is mainly used to rank
different LTE cells according to their signal strength as an input for handover
and cell reselection decisions. The RSRP of a cell is defined as the linear av-
erage over the power contributions (in Watts) of the Resource Elements (REs)
which carry cell-specific RS within the considered measurement bandwidth.
Normally the RSs transmitted on the first eNodeB antenna port are used for
RSRP determination, but the RS on the second antenna port can also be used
if the UE can determine that they are being transmitted. If the UE is equipped
with multiple antennas, the reported RSRP value is not permitted to be lower
than the RSRP computed on the individual branches. See 3GPP TS36.214
Section 5.1.1.

RSRQ Reference Signal Received Quality. RSRQ is an LTE measurement which pro-
vides a cell-specific signal quality metric. Similarly to Reference Signal Re-
ceived Power (RSRP), this measurement is mainly used to rank different LTE
cells according to their signal quality as an input for handover and cell rese-
lection decisions, for example in scenarios for which RSRP measurements do
not provide sufficient information to perform reliable mobility decisions. The
RSRQ is defined as the ratio N · RSRP/(LTE carrier RSSI), where N is the
number of Resource Blocks (RBs) of the LTE carrier Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) measurement bandwidth. While RSRP is an indicator of the
wanted signal strength, RSRQ additionally takes the interference level into ac-
count due to the inclusion of RSSI. RSRQ therefore enables the combined
effect of signal strength and interference to be reported in an efficient way. If
the UE is equipped with multiple antennas, the reported RSRQ value is not
permitted to be lower than the RSRQ computed on the individual branches.
See 3GPP TS36.214 Section 5.1.2.

RSSI Received Signal Strength Indicator. A measurement defined as the total re-
ceived wideband power observed by a UE from all sources, including co-
channel serving and non-serving cells, adjacent channel interference and ther-
mal noise within the measurement bandwidth. For LTE it is not reported as an
independent measurement, but is an input to the derivation of RSRQ. For RSSI
in UTRA and GSM, see 3GPP TS36.214 Sections 5.1.5, 5.1.7 and 5.1.8.

RTCP Real-time Transport Control Protocol. RTCP provides control signalling func-
tionality to support data packets transmitted by Real-time Transport Protocol
(RTP). Its primary function is to monitor transmission statistics to provide
Quality of Service (QoS) feedback for the RTP data. See IETF RFC3550,
www.ietf.org.

RTD Round-Trip Delay. RTD usually refers to twice the one-way propagation delay
for a radio signal between a source node and a destination node. In some in-
stances it may also include a processing time at the destination node, for the
response signal to be generated.

RTP Real-time Transport Protocol. RTP is a communication protocol which pro-
vides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmit-
ting real-time data, such as audio and video over multicast or unicast networks.
See IETF RFC3550, www.ietf.org.

RTT Round-Trip Time. RTT usually refers to the time between retransmissions in
a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) protocol. It therefore consists of
the total time required for a packet to travel from a source node to a destina-
tion node, for decoding and ACKnowledgement/Negative ACKnowledgment
(ACK/NACK) generation at the destination, for transmission of a response
back to the source, and for processing at the source to formulate the retrans-
mission.

RV Redundancy Version. An RV is a particular set of systematic and parity bits
transmitted from a channel-coded data packet. In Incremental Redundancy (IR)
schemes, successive retransmissions of the packet use different RVs. In LTE,
each RV is defined by a particular starting point in the rate matching circular
buffer filled from the output of the turbo coder. The RV of each retransmis-
sion must be known by the receiver (either by explicit signalling or specified
rules) in order to enable correct combining with other transmissions of the same
packet. See 3GPP TS36.212 Section 5.1.4.1.2.

Rx Receive.

RxD Receive Diversity. The use of two or more physically separate antennas for
reception.

S/P Serial-to-Parallel. The conversion of a serial sequence of symbols into a paral-
lel set of sequences, usually by mapping each symbol (or group of symbols) of
the serial sequence to a different one of the parallel sequences in turn.
S1 The interface between an eNodeB and the Core Network (CN). See 3GPP
TS36.300 Section 19 and TS36.410 to TS36.414.


S1-AP S1 Application Protocol. The radio network layer signalling protocol of the S1
interface. See 3GPP TS36.413.

S1-U S1-User plane. Provides non-guaranteed delivery of user plane Protocol Data
Units (PDU) between the eNodeB and the Serving-GateWay (S-GW). It is built
on Internet Protocol (IP) transport, and GPRS Tunnelling Protocol-User Plane
(GTP-U) is used on top of User Data Protocol (UDP) / Internet Protocol (IP)
to carry the user plane PDUs between the eNodeB and the S-GW. It supports
inter-eNodeB path switching during handover. See 3GPP TS36.300 Section
19.1 and TS36.414.

S5 The interface between a Serving-GateWay (S-GW) and a Packet Data Network
GateWay (P-GW) within the same Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN).

S8 The interface between a Serving-GateWay (S-GW) and a Packet Data Network
GateWay (P-GW) in different Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN).

SABM Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode. A message in the High-Level Data Link
Control (HDLC) protocol, used to initiate Asynchronous Balanced Mode
(ABM).

SAE System Architecture Evolution. The part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS)
which involves the non-radio aspects. It includes the Evolved Packet Core
(EPC) network, and accompanies LTE.

SAP Service Access Point. A point at which a higher layer application may access
the services of a lower protocol layer. See 3GPP TS23.110.
SAPI Service Access Point Identifier. An address field identifying a destination Ser-
vice Access Point (SAP). See 3GPP TS23.110 Section 6.1.3.

SAW Stop-And-Wait. A simple Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) technique, in
which, upon transmission of a transport block, the transmitter stops and awaits
feedback from the receiver before making any further transmissions. If an AC-
Knowledgment (ACK) does not reach the transmitter before a certain time has
elapsed, or if a NegativeACK (NACK) is received, the transmitter retransmits
the same transport block. Such a simple SAW operation cannot on its own uti-
lize the transmission resources during the period between the first transmission
and the retransmission. Therefore multiple SAWprocesses can be interlaced in
time so that all the transmission resources can be used by one of the processes.
Each SAW process is responsible for a separate SAW operation and manages
a separate buffer.

SC-FDMA Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access. SC-FDMA, like Orthogo-
nal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), divides the transmission band-
width into multiple parallel subcarriers, with the orthogonality between the
subcarriers being maintained in frequency-selective channels by the use of
a Cyclic Prefix (CP). The use of a CP prevents Inter-Symbol Interference
(ISI) between SC-FDMA information blocks. However, unlike OFDM, in SC-
FDMA the signal modulated onto a given subcarrier is a linear combination
(typically via a DFT precoding operation) of all the data symbols transmitted at
the same time instant. Thus in each symbol period, all the transmitted subcarri-
ers of an SC-FDMA signal carry a component of each modulated data symbol.
This gives SC-FDMA its single-carrier property, which results in the lower
Cubic Metric (CM) and Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) than pure mul-
ticarrier transmission schemes such as OFDM. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section
5.6.

SCH Synchronization CHannel. A downlink channel in Wideband Code Division

SCM, developed in the IST-WINNER project. The extension was designed to
increase the channel model bandwidth from 5MHz to 100MHz, while remain-
ing simple and backward-compatible with the original SCM. See www.ist-
winner.org.

SCTP Stream Control Transmission Protocol. A reliable transport layer protocol, de-
fined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), operating on top of a
connectionless packet network such as Internet Protocol (IP). It was originally
designed for transporting signalling messages for the Public Switched Tele-
phone Network (PSTN) over IP networks. It ensures reliable, non-duplicated
message delivery. In addition it can handle multiple streams and is tolerant
of network-level faults through support of multi-homing. The design of SCTP
also includes congestion avoidance and resistance to flooding and masquerade
attacks. See IETF RFC4960, www.ietf.org.

SDMA Spatial Division Multiple Access. A type of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO) technology by which parallel streams are transmitted, with each
stream being addressed to a different user. Each user is enabled to decode its
own stream by virtue of its antenna(s) being spatially separated from those of
other users, together with spatial decorrelation of the transmitting antennas.

tain protocol layer receives from a higher layer, for which the layer in question
provides a transport service. The SDU of layer n is a Packet Data Unit (PDU)
of layer n + 1. At the receiving side, the process is reversed: each layer passes
SDUs up to the layer above, where they are received as PDUs.
SEM Spectrum Emission Mask. A mask defined for out-of-channel emissions of
a transmitter relative to the in-channel power. See 3GPP TS36.101 Section
6.6.2.1.

SFBC Space-Frequency Block Code. A frequency-domain version of the well-known
Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs), also known as Alamouti codes. This fam-
ily of codes is designed so that the transmitted diversity streams are orthogonal
and achieve the optimal Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) with a linear receiver.
Such orthogonal codes only exist for the case of two transmit antennas. Gener-
alizations are possible for higher dimensions.

SFDR Spurious-Free Dynamic Range. The input power range in which the received
signal can be detected in the presence of noise, and amplified, without being ex-
posed to InterModulation Distortion (IMD) from the non-linear amplification
of interfering signals.

the fixed network for Packet Switched (PS) services, performing all neces-
sary functions in order to handle packet transmission to and from the mobile

are broadcast to allow UEs to connect successfully to the network. SIs is struc-
tured into System Information Blocks (SIB), each of which contains a set of
functionally-related parameters. See 3GPP TS36.331 Sections 5.2, 6.2.2.7 and
6.3.1.

SIB System Information Block. The System Information (SI) is broadcast in SIBs,
each of which contains a set of functionally-related parameters. In LTE, the SIB
types include: the Master Information Block (MIB), which contains a limited
number of the most frequently transmitted parameters which are essential for
a UE’s initial access to the network; SIB1, which contains parameters needed
to determine if a cell is suitable for cell selection, as well as information about
the time domain scheduling of the other SIBs; SIB2, which includes common
and shared channel information; SIB3 - SIB8, which include parameters used
to control intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-Radio Access Technology
(RAT) cell reselection. See 3GPP TS36.331 Sections 6.2.2.7 and 6.3.1.

SIC Successive Interference Cancellation. A decoding technique where multiple
data streams which are individually channel-coded and are received simultane-
ously, are processed one by one, from the strongest to the weakest stream. The
process is handled in a serial manner in contrast to Parallel Interference Can-
cellation (PIC) where the streams are simultaneously processed at each stage.
In SIC, the processing sequence typically consists of detection, decoding, re-
modulating, re-encoding and subtraction from the total received signal.

SIM Subscriber Identity Module. The entity that contains the International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) which uniquely identifies a subscriber. Without a
valid IMSI, GSM service is not accessible. The main function of the SIM is to
provide a means to authenticate the user, but it may also store other subscriber-
related information or applications such as text messages and phone book
contacts. The equivalent of a SIM in UMTS and LTE is a Universal Subscriber
Identity Module (USIM). See 3GPP TS42.017.

sources (typically thermal noise, modelled as Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN)), which are simultaneously-received.

application-layer signalling protocol. It is used for setting up, modifying, and
terminating sessions with one or more participants consisting of one or several
media streams. These sessions include two-way voice or video call, collabora-
tive multi-media conference session, streaming multimedia distribution, instant
messaging and online games. It allows parameters (e.g. addresses or ports,
inviting more participants, adding or deleting media streams) to be changed
in mid-session. See IETF RFC3261, www.ietf.org.

SIR Signal to Interference Ratio. The ratio of the average received modulated
carrier power to the average simultaneously-received co-channel interference

SI-RNTI System Information Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI). A fixed
identifier used on the Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) to indi-
cate broadcast System Information Blocks (SIBs) transmitted on the Physical
Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH). The SI-RNTI is known a priori to all
UEs and thus allows SIBs to be distinguished from UEs’ data transmitted on
the same channel. It is transmitted as a scrambling code applied to the Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC) of the PDCCH transmission. See 3GPP TS36.321
Section 7.1.

SISO Single-Input Single-Output. A transmission scheme between a transmitter
equipped with a single antenna and a receiver equipped with a single antenna.
SISO Soft-Input Soft-Output. A term applied to a Forward Error Correction (FEC)
decoder, which processes soft (i.e. non-binary) input values to produce new soft
output values (typically A-Posteriori Probabilities (APP)). A SISO decoder can
be used to decode convolutional codes as well as turbo codes; in the latter case,
two SISO decoders operate in parallel, each refining the outputs of the other
and producing new extrinsic information to pass back to the other for the next
iteration.

SMC Security Mode Command. The SMC procedure consists of a round-trip of mes-
sages between an eNodeB and a UE. It allows an active UE and a serving
eNodeB to agree upon algorithms for Radio Resource Control (RRC) ciphering
integrity protection, user-plane ciphering, Non-Access Stratum (NAS) cipher-
ing integrity protection, and Key Derivation for the Evolved Packet System
(EPS). See 3GPP TS33.401, Section 7.2.4.

S-MCCH Secondary Multicast Control CHannel. A channel discussed for the implemen-
tation of Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) in a future
release of LTE. It would be responsible for signalling MBMS control infor-
mation for a Multimedia Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) area.
See 3GPP TS36.300 Section 15.3.5.

SMS Short Message Service. SMS (also commonly referred to as "text messaging")
is a communications protocol allowing the interchange of short text messages
of up to 160 characters between mobile devices. SMS is similar to paging, ex-
cept that it is a store-and-forward system and therefore does not require the
mobile phone to be active and within range. Messages are sent to a Short Mes-
sage Service Centre (SMSC), stored and delivered to the mobile when it is
connected to the network.

SN Sequence Number. A label attached to a packet to indicate the order in which
the packet was transmitted with respect to other packets. As an example, SNs
are used in the headers of Radio Link Control (RLC) Protocol Data Units
(PDUs) to enable reordering in the receiver. The SN is incremented by one for
each PDU. In the case of an Acknowledged Mode Data (AMD) PDU segment,
the SN indicates the sequence number of the original AMD PDU of which the
AMD PDU segment is a part. See 3GPP TS36.322 Section 6.2.2.3.

SND Sequence Number Down. A GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) sequence num-
ber of the next downlink N- Protocol Data Unit (PDU) to be sent to the mobile
station. See 3GPP TS29.060 Section 7.7.29.

GPRS Support Node (GGSN). See 3GPP TS29.060 Section 7.7.29.
SO Segmentation Offset. A 15-bit field in the header of an Acknowledged Mode
Data (AMD) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) segment indicating the starting position
of the segment within the original AMD PDU. See 3GPP TS36.322 Section
6.2.2.7.

SON Self-Optimizing/Organizing Network. A feature of LTE which is designed to
support self-configuration for newly-added cells and self-optimization for ex-
isting ones (with minimal human involvement). Measurements (e.g. of radio
channel reception levels and traffic loads) can be collected and processed to
support these functions, for example to provide the targeted service availability
and quality as efficiently as possible and to resolve capacity/coverage gaps in
case of cell failure. See 3GPP TR36.902.

SPID Subscriber Profile IDentity for Radio Access Technology / Frequency Selec-
tion Priority. A parameter received by the eNodeB via the S1 interface which
refers to user information (e.g. mobility profile, service usage profile). SPID is
used to define camp priorities in Idle mode and to control inter- Radio Access
Technology (inter-RAT) / inter-frequency handover in Connected mode. See
3GPP TS36.300 Section 16.1.8.

SPL Sound Pressure Level. A measure of the amplitude of a sound wave, measured
in dBPa. Used in tests for audio noise arising from electromagnetic interfer-
ence. See 3GPP TS36.124 Annex A.

SPS Semi-Persistent Scheduling. SPS enables radio resources to be semi-statically
configured and allocated to a UE for a longer time period than one subframe,
avoiding the need for specific downlink assignment messages or uplink grant
messages over the Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) for each
subframe. SPS is useful for services where the timing and amount of radio
resources needed are predictable, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
thus reducing considerably the overhead of the PDCCH compared to dynamic
scheduling. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section 5.10.

SPS-C-RNTI Semi-Persistent Scheduling Cell- Radio Network Temporary Identifier. An
identifier of the scheduling messages transmitted on the Physical Downlink
Control CHannel (PDCCH) for semi-persistently scheduled Physical Downlink
Shared CHannel (PDSCH) data transmissions. It allows the UE to differentiate
these messages from those used for dynamic scheduling messages identified
by Cell- Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI). It is transmitted as a
scrambling code applied to the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of the PD-
CCH transmission. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section 7.1.

SR Scheduling Request. An SR is employed by the UE to request allocation of
uplink resources when having data ready for transmission but no resource grant
for use of the Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH). It is transmitted on
the Physical Uplink Control CHannel (PUCCH). See 3GPP TS36.312 Section
5.4.4.

Link (UL) to enable the eNodeB to perform channel sounding, for example to
support frequency-domain scheduling. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section 5.5.3.

SRVCC Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (VCC). SRVCC refers to continuity
between Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)-over-Packet
Switched (PS) access and Circuit Switched (CS) calls that are anchored in IMS
when the UE is capable of transmitting/receiving on only one of those access
networks at a given time. See 3GPP TS23.216.

SS System Simulator. A simulator used for conformance testing of UEs. It models
at least one eNodeB and often some interference sources, enabling the UE’s
performance to be evaluated. See 3GPP TS36.508.

SSC Secondary Synchronization Code. The code transmitted on the WCDMA
Secondary Synchronization Channel (S-SCH). See 3GPP TS25.211 Section
5.3.3.5.

SSS Secondary Synchronization Signal. The SSS is used by the UE to detect the
LTE frame timing and to obtain the physical layer cell identity group. It is trans-
mitted twice in each 10 ms frame. The SSS sequences are based on maximum
length sequences, known as M-sequences. Each SSS sequence is constructed
by interleaving, in the frequency-domain, two length-31 Binary Phase Shift
Keying (BPSK)-modulated sequences. These two codes are two different cyclic
shifts of a single length-31 M-sequence. The cyclic shift indices of the M-
sequences are derived from a function of the physical layer cell identity group.
The two codes are alternated between the first and second SSS transmissions
in each radio frame. This enables the UE to determine the 10 ms radio frame
timing from a single observation of a SSS. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section 6.11.1.
SSS_RA Secondary Synchronization Signal - to - Reference Signal Energy Per Resource
Element ratio. The transmitted energy ratio (per resource element) between the
Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS) and the downlink Reference Signal
(RS), used in defining performance requirements. See 3GPP TS36.101 Annex
C.

STBC Space-Time Block Code. A transmit diversity technique involving the trans-
mission of multiple copies of a data stream using multiple antennas and multi-
ple symbol periods, in order to improve the reliability of the received data. The
best-known STBC technique is the Alamouti scheme, whereby the transmitted
diversity streams are designed to be orthogonal and achieve the optimal Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) with a linear receiver. Such orthogonal codes only exist
for the case of two transmit antennas. Generalizations are possible for higher
dimensions.

S-TMSI System Architecture Evolution - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity. The
S-TMSI is a unique identifier assigned to the UE by the Mobility Management
Entity (MME) in order to identify the UE context while supporting subscriber
identity confidentiality. See 3GPP TS23.003 Section 2.9.

STTD Space-Time Transmit Diversity. The name given to a transmit diversity scheme
used in WCDMA. It uses two transmit antennas, with the same data being
transmitted from both NodeB antennas, using a space-time block code to en-
sure orthogonality of the signals from the two transmit antennas. See 3GPP
TS25.211 Section 5.3.1.1.1.

SU-MIMO Single-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output. In relation to the LTE downlink,
SU-MIMO refers to the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas to trans-
mit possibly multiple independent data streams simultaneously to a single UE
using the same resource blocks. It corresponds to Physical Downlink Shared
CHannel (PDSCH) transmission modes 3 and 4. See 3GPP TS36.213 Sections
7.1.3 and 7.1.4.

SVD Singular-Value Decomposition. A factorization of a rectangular matrix (real
or complex). The SVD of an m × n matrix M is obtained as M = UVH,
where U and V are m × m and n × n unitary matrices and the matrix  is
an m × n diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal.
The diagonal entries of  are the singular values of M. The columns of U
and V are, respectively, left- and right-singular vectors for the corresponding
singular values. SVD can for example be used to construct the optimal transmit
and receive beamforming matrices in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
applications.

SVN Software Version Number.
TA Tracking Area. A TA includes one or several E-UTRAN cells. The network
allocates a list with one or more TAs to the UE. In certain operation modes,
the UE may move freely in all TAs of the list without updating the Mobility
Management Entity (MME).


TA Timing Advance. A mechanism by which the uplink transmission timing is set
earlier than the downlink timing as received at the UE, in order to compensate
for propagation delay. The timing advance procedure in LTE is divided into
Initial Timing Advance and Timing Advance Updates. The Initial TA is used
after the UE first synchronizes its receiver to the downlink transmissions of the
eNodeB and is set by means of the random access procedure: the eNodeB can
estimate the uplink timing from the random access preamble and sends timing
advance command within the Random Access Response (RAR) message. The
TA Updates are needed from time to time to update the uplink transmission
timing to counteract changes in the arrival time at the eNodeB; it is performed
by a closed-loop mechanism whereby the eNodeB measures the received up-
link timing and issues timing advance update commands to the UE by means of
Medium Access Control (MAC) control elements. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section
5.2 and TS36.213 Section 4.2.3.

TA Time Alignment. The main role of time alignment is to counteract differing
propagation delays between different UEs for uplink transmissions and have
all UEs symbols time-aligned at the eNodeB is order to preserve the intra-cell
orthogonality. This is achieved by applying a timing advance at the UE trans-
mitter, relative to the received downlink timing. See 3GPP TS36.321 Section
5.2 and TS36.213 Section 4.2.3.

TAC Tracking Area Code. The TAC is part of the Tracking Area Identity (TAI). It is
a 16-bit integer. See 3GPP TS23.003 Section 19.4.2.3.

TAD Traffic Aggregate Description. The TAD consists of a description of the packet
filter(s) for the traffic flow aggregate (where a traffic flow aggregate consists of
data traffic for a particular destination).

TAI Tracking Area Identity. This is the identity used to identify tracking areas. It
is composed of a Tracking Area Code (TAC), a Mobile Network Code (MNC)
and a Mobile Country Code (MCC). See 3GPP TS23.003 Section 19.4.2.3.

TAT Timing Advance Timer. A timer whose duration is configured by the eNodeB,
which is restarted each time a timing advance command is received. As long
as the timer is running, the UE can consider that its uplink is synchronized and
can transmit directly using the Physical Uplink Control CHannel (PUCCH) or
Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH). If the timer expires, the UE must
use the Random Access CHannel (RACH) to reacquire uplink synchroniza-
tion before any other uplink transmissions can be made. See 3GPP TS36.321
Section 5.2.

TAU Tracking Area Update. The procedure by which the UE updates the network as
to its new location, either periodically or whenever it moves out of its current
Tracking Area (TA). See 3GPP TS23.401 Section 4.3.5.2.

source entities to support the unidirectional transfer of upper layer Packet Data
Units (PDUs) on packet data physical channels. See 3GPP TS44.060 Section
5.2.1.

mine whether certain specification requirements are met.
TCH Traffic CHannel. A channel carrying data traffic.

TCP Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a reliable host-to-host protocol used in
packet-switched communication networks together with the Internet Protocol
(IP). While IP handles the actual transmission of the packets, TCP takes care
of the control of the packets, requesting retransmission of lost ones and rear-
ranging out-of-order packets. It also helps minimize network congestion. See
IETF RFC4614, www.ietf.org.

TDD Time Division Duplex. A mode of bidirectional communication in which trans-
missions in each direction take place on the same carrier frequency but in
different time slots.

TDL Tapped Delay Line. A model in which a signal is delayed in multiple successive
stages, with outputs being taken at one or more points between the stages.
Such models are frequently used to emulate the different delays of a multipath
propagation channel. Similar structures are used in linear equalizer receivers,
where the outputs from each tap are individually weighted and then combined.

TDM Time Division Multiplexing. A method of multiplexing different data signals,
whereby the channel is divided into multiple time slots and the different signals
are mapped to different time slots.

TDMA Time Division Multiple Access. An access scheme allowing multiple users to
share the same frequency channel by dividing the channel into different time
slots. Each user is allocated a different time slot.

TD-SCDMA Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access. A 3G mobile
telecommunications standard, based on the 1.28 Mcps Time Division Duplex
(TDD) mode of UMTS. TD-SCDMA is termed “synchronous” as the uplink
signals are synchronized at the base station receiver by means of regular timing
adjustments.

TE Terminal Equipment. Equipment that provides the functions necessary for the
operation of access protocols by a user. See ITU-T I.112, www.itu.int/itu-t.

TEID Tunnelling End IDentity. Uniquely identifies a tunnel endpoint in a receiving
GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP)-User-plane or GTP-Control plane entity. See
3GPP TS29.281 Section 4.2.1.

TF Transport Format. A term typically used to describe the modulation and coding
scheme applied for the transmission of a transport block.

TFT Traffic Flow Template. TFTs are used to discriminate between different user
payloads. They use Internet Protocol (IP) header information such as source
and destination IP addresses and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port
numbers to filter packets such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) from web
browsing traffic so that each can be sent down the respective bearers with ap-
propriate Quality of Service (QoS). See 3GPP TS23.060 Section 15.3.

TGRP Transmission Gap Repetition Period. LTE can provide regularly-spaced trans-
mission gaps to enable a UE to identify and measure inter-frequency and/or
inter- Radio Access Technology (inter-RAT) cells. During these gaps the UE
does not transmit any data and is not expected to tune its receiver to the E-
UTRAN serving carrier frequency. The TGRP is the time between the start of
one transmission gap and the start of the next. See 3GPP TS36.133 Section
8.1.2.
TH Temperature High. Denotes the upper temperature at which extreme-condition
conformance testing is carried out for a UE, namely +55?C (See also Temper-
ature Low (TL)). See 3GPP TS36.508 Section 4.1.1.

TI Transaction Identifier. The UE dynamically allocates a TI for UE-requested
Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context activation. TIs for network-requested PDP
context activation are dynamically allocated by the network. A corresponding
allocation is also needed for Evolved Packet System (EPS) Bearers in or-
der to successfully transfer Bearers to GERAN/UTRAN. See 3GPP TS23.401
Section 5.2.1.

TIN Temporary Identifier used in Next update. A parameter which identifies the
UE identity that the UE is to indicate in the next Routing Area Update (RAU)
Request or Tracking Area Update (TAU) Request message. The TIN also iden-
tifies the status of Idle state Signalling Reduction (ISR) activation in the UE.
See 3GPP TS23.401 Section 4.3.5.6.

TL Temperature Low. Denotes the lower temperature at which extreme-condition
conformance testing is carried out for a UE, namely -10?C (See also Temper-
ature High (TH)). See 3GPP TS36.508 Section 4.1.1.

TLLI Temporary Logical Link Identity. Used for addressing resources allocated for
GPRS services at Radio Link Control (RLC)/Medium Access Control (MAC)
layer communication between the mobile station and the Serving GPRS Sup-
port Node (SGSN). Three types of TLLI exist: Local TLLI (for normal use),
Foreign TLLI (for use when crossing a Routing Area boundary) and Random
TLLI (used for initial access). See 3GPP TS23.060.

TM Transparent Mode. One of three Radio Link Control (RLC) data transmission
modes (the other two being Acknowledged Mode (AM) and Unacknowledged
Mode (UM)). The TM RLC entity is transparent to the Protocol Data Units
(PDU) that pass through it – no functions are performed and no RLC over-
head is added; thus an RLC Service Data Unit (SDU) is directly mapped to an
RLC PDU and vice versa. The use of TM RLC is very restricted: only Radio
Resource Control (RRC) messages which do not need RLC configuration can
utilize the TM RLC, such as broadcast system information messages and pag-
ing messages. TM RLC is not used for user plane data transmission in LTE.
See 3GPP TS36.322.

TMA Tower Mounted Amplifier. A Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) mounted as close as
possible to the antenna in the base station. A TMA can enable the base station
noise figure to be reduced and therefore improve the overall efficiency of the
uplink transmission. See 3GPP TR25.818 and TS25.466 Section 6.8.
TMD Transparent Mode Data. The type of Protocol Data Unit (PDU) used in Radio
Link Control (RLC) Transparent Mode (TM). It consists only of a data field
and does not have any RLC headers. Since no segmentation or concatenation
is performed, an RLC Service Data Unit (SDU) is directly mapped to a TMD
PDU. See 3GPP TS36.322 Section 9.2.1.2.

of the channel bandwidth) and an element corresponding to the waveform of
the transmitted signal.

ical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) to inform the UE as to which
codebook (precoding matrix) index is used for transmission to that UE on the
Physical Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH). It enables the UE to form the
correct phase reference for demodulating the PDSCH data, based on the cor-
rect linear combination of the common reference signals. See 3GPP TS36.212
Section 5.3.3.1.

that can be used by the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer. A TrCH
is used to transmit one data flow with a given Quality of Service (QoS) over
the radio interface. A number of TrCHs can be active at the same time and
multiplexed at the physical layer. The transport channels are configured at call
setup by the network.

dio Access Network (RAN) and TSG GSM EDGE Radio Access Network
(GERAN). Each TSG is comprised of a number of Working Groups (WGs)
with responsibility for a specific aspect of the specifications.

TSTD Time-Switched Transmit Diversity. TSTD is a multiple antenna transmission
technique where a signal is transmitted from only a subset (usually one) of the
available antennas at any time. The selected subset changes periodically such
that a block of data is transmitted from different antennas at different times. It
is used in the LTE uplink. See 3GPP TS36.213 Section 8.7.

TT Test Tolerance. The amount by which a core specification performance require-
ment is relaxed to take into account factors such as measurement uncertainty.

(e.g. ACKnowledgement (ACK) / Negative ACK (NACK) and Channel Quality
Indicator (CQI)) transmitted from the UE to the eNodeB. This information is
usually transmitted using the Physical Uplink Control CHannel (PUCCH). See
3GPP TS36.212 Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4.

UDP User Datagram Protocol. A transport layer protocol used along with the Inter-
net Protocol (IP). UDP is not designed to support reliable transfer, and therefore
packets may arrive out of order, be duplicated, or be lost without notice. UDP
assumes that error checking and correction is either not necessary or performed
in the application. UDP does not use handshaking between sending and re-
ceiving transport-layer entities prior to sending a packet and is therefore said
to be connectionless. The simplicity of UDP keeps the overhead from using
the protocol low. Common applications that use UDP include time-sensitive
applications (where loss of packets is preferable to delayed packets) and broad-
casting (where feedback is not supported). See IETF RFC768, www.ietf.org.
UE User Equipment. The mobile unit which allows a user to access network ser-
vices, connecting to the UTRAN or E-UTRAN via the radio interface. A UE
can be subdivided into a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and a Mo-
bile Equipment (ME). See 3GPP TS21.905 Section 3.

provides a unidirectional data transfer service and is used when retransmission
is not necessary, for example for delay-sensitive and error-tolerant real-time
applications, especially Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and other delay
sensitive streaming services. Point-to-multipoint services such as Multime-
dia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) also use UM RLC. See 3GPP

(UM). The PDU header includes a sequence number to support reordering and
duplicate-detection. See 3GPP TS36.322.

in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radio systems, where the beam-
forming matrix is unitary. An N × N matrix G is unitary if GHG = GGH =
IN where IN is the N × N identity matrix.

UPE User Plane Entity. The entity managing protocols on the user plane. The main
functions of the UPE include terminating, for idle state UEs, the downlink data
path and triggering/initiating paging when downlink data arrive for the UE.
It also stores and manages UE contexts and performs replication of the user
traffic in case of interception.

U-plane User plane. The user plane is the protocol stack carrying user data, as opposed
to control signalling which is carried by the control plane. See 3GPP TS36.300
Section 4.3.1.

UpPTS Uplink Pilot TimeSlot. A special uplink timeslot occurring in the second (and
in some configurations the 7th) subframes of each radio frame when LTE is
operated in Time Division Duplex (TDD). It has a length of 1 or 2 Single
Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) symbols and is used
only for transmission of a shortened Random Access CHannel (RACH) pream-
ble or Sounding Reference Signal (SRS). The name UpPTS is derived from
Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA).
See 3GPP TS36.211 Section 4.2.

tion of UE activity (for example the next Non-Access Stratum (NAS) activity
by the UE). See 3GPP TS23.401.

USIM Universal Subscriber Identity Module. The USIM is one component which can
run on a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) smart card. It is the UMTS
and LTE equivalent of the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) used in GSM. The
USIM stores the security key identifying a mobile service subscriber, enabling
the subscriber to access the service. It can also store information such as text
messages and phone book contacts.

UTRA Universal Terrestrial Radio Access. The radio access solution for UMTS.

case of UMTS, between the NodeB and the UE).

VCB Virtual Circular Buffer. The Circular Buffer (CB) used for rate matching in
LTE. It is ‘virtual’ in the sense that it does not require the implementation of
any actual physical buffer; for any combination of Transport Block Sizes (TBS)
and Redundancy Versions (RVs), the desired output bits for transmission can be
obtained directly from the output of the turbo encoder using simple addressing
based on sub-block permutation. See 3GPP TS36.212 Section 5.1.4.1.2.

See 3GPP TS36.101 Annex E.2.

VL Lower extreme Voltage. The UE-manufacturer-declared supply voltage level
(from a battery or mains) below which a UE has to fulfil all the LTE specifica-
tion requirements. If the supply voltage falls below this value, the UE must take

(HPLMN).

VRB Virtual Resource Block. A logical unit of transmission resource in the LTE
downlink, associated with the same dimensions and number of Resource Ele-
ments (REs) as a Physical Resource Block (RB). VRBs are mapped to PRBs
in pairs. Two types of VRB exist: localized VRBs and distributed VRBs. A
pair of localized VRBs is mapped to a pair of PRBs which occupy the same
12 subcarriers in the same subframe. A pair of distributed VRBs is mapped to
a pair of PRBs such that one of the PRBs occupies one set of 12 subcarriers
in the first slot of a subframe and the other PRB occupies a different set of
12 subcarriers in the second slot of the same subframe. Distributed VRBs are
used for frequency diverse scheduling while localized VRBs may be used for
frequency selective scheduling. See 3GPP TS36.211 Section 6.2.3.

C.

xCH_RB xCHannel to Reference Signal Energy Per Resource Element ratio. The trans-
mitted energy ratio (per Resource Element (RE)) between an arbitrary down-
link channel ‘xCH’ and the downlink Reference Signal (RS), in all transmit-
